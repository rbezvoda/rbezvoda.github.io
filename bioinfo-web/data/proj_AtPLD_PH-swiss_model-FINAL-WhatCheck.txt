********** REPORT OF PROTEIN ANALYSIS  by the WHAT IF program **********
************************************************************************

Date : 2004-05-18
This report was created by WHAT IF version 19970813-1517

INTRODUCTION
------------

This document contains a report of findings by the WHAT IF program
during the analysis of one or more proteins. It contains a separate section
for each of the proteins that have been analysed. Each reported fact has
an assigned severity, one of:

* error:   severe errors encountered during the analyses. Items marked
           as errors are considered severe problems requiring immediate
           attention.

* warning: Either less severe problems or uncommon structural
           features. These still need special attention.

* note:    Statistical values, plots, or other verbose results of
           tests and analyses that have been performed.


If alternate conformations are present, only the first is
evaluated.

Hydrogen atoms are only included if explicitly requested, and even then
they are not used by all checks.

Some notations need a little explanation:

RESIDUE: Residues in tables are normally given in 3-5 parts:
  - A number. This is the internal sequence number of the residue used
    by WHAT IF.
  - The residue name. Normally this is a three letter amino acid name.
  - The sequence number, between brackets. This is the residue number
    as it was given in the input file. It can be followed by the insertion
    code.
  - The chain identifier. A single character. If no chain identifier
    was given in the input file, this will be invisible.
  - A model number (only for NMR structures).

Z-VALUE: To indicate the normality of a score, the score may be
   expressed as a Z-value or Z-score. This is just the number of
   standard deviations that the score deviates from the expected
   value.  A property of Z-values is that the root-mean-square of a
   group of Z-values (the RMS Z-value) is expected to be 1.0. Z-values
   above 4.0 and below -4.0 are very uncommon. If a Z-score is used in
   WHAT IF, the accompanying text will explain how the expected value
   and standard deviation were obtained.

# 4 # Note: Matthews coefficient OK
The Matthews coefficient [REF] is defined as the density of the
protein structure in cubic Angstroms per Dalton. Normal values are
between 1.5 (tightly packed, little room for solvent) and 4.0
(loosely packed, much space for solvent). Some very loosely packed
structures can get values a bit higher than that.

No errors were detected in the atom names for non-hydrogen atoms.
 
# 15 # Warning: Chirality deviations detected
The atoms listed in the table below have an improper dihedral value
that is deviating from expected values.

Improper dihedrals are a measure of the chirality/planarity of the
structure at a specific atom. Values around -35 or +35 are expected
for chiral atoms, and values around 0 for planar atoms. Planar side
chains are left out of the calculations, these are better handled
by the planarity checks.

Three numbers are given for each atom in the table. The first is
the Z-score for the improper dihedral. The second number is the
measured improper dihedral. The third number is the expected value
for this atom type. A final column contains an extra warning if the
chirality for an atom is opposite to the expected value.

# 16 # Warning: High improper dihedral angle deviations
The RMS Z-score for the improper dihedrals in the structure is high.
For well refined structures this number is expected to be around 1.0.
The fact that it is higher than 1.5 in this structure could be an
indication of overrefinement.
 
 Improper dihedral RMS Z-score : 2.071
 
# 17 # Note: Chain names are OK
All chain names assigned to polymer molecules are unique, and all
residue numbers are strictly increasing within each chain.

All atomic occupancy factors ('weights') fall in the 0.0--1.0 range.
 
# 19 # Note: No missing atoms detected
All expected atoms are present.
 
# 20 # Note: OXT check OK
All required C-terminal oxygen atoms are present.
 
# 21 # Note: No extra C-terminal groups found
No C-terminal groups are present for non C-terminal residues
 
# 22 # Warning: Unusual bond lengths
The bond lengths listed in the table below were found to deviate
more than 4 sigma from standard bond lengths (both standard values
and sigma for amino acid residues have been taken from Engh and
Huber [REF], for DNA they were taken from Parkinson et al [REF]). In
the table below for each unusual bond the bond length and the
number of standard deviations it differs from the normal value is
given.

Atom names starting with "<" belong to the previous residue in the
chain. If the second atom name is "--SS", the disulphide bridge has
a deviating length.

lengths (values for Protein residues were taken from Engh and Huber
[REF], for DNA/RNA from Parkinson et al [REF]).

# 24 # Note: No bond length directionality
Comparison of bond distances with Engh and Huber [REF] standard
values for protein residues and Parkinson et al [REF] values for
DNA/RNA does not show significant systematic deviations.
 
# 25 # Warning: Unusual bond angles
The bond angles listed in the table below were found to deviate
more than 4 sigma from standard bond angles (both standard values
and sigma for protein residues have been taken from Engh and Huber
[REF], for DNA/RNA from Parkinson et al [REF]).  In the table below
for each strange angle the bond angle and the number of standard
deviations it differs from the standard values is given. Please
note that disulphide bridges are neglected. Atoms starting with "<"
belong to the previous residue in the sequence.

# 26 # Note: Normal bond angle variability
Bond angles were found to deviate normally from the mean standard
bond angles (normal values for protein residues were taken from
Engh and Huber [REF], for DNA/RNA from Parkinson et al [REF]). The
RMS Z-score given below is expected to be around 1.0 for a normally
restrained data set, and this is indeed observed for very high
resolution X-ray structures.  More common values are around 1.55
 
 RMS Z-score for bond angles: 1.719
 RMS-deviation in bond angles: 3.172
 
# 27 # Error: Side chain planarity problems
The side chains of the residues listed in the table below contain a
planar group that was found to deviate from planarity by more than
4.0 times the expected value.  For an amino acid residue that has a
side chain with a planar group, the RMS deviation of the atoms to a
least squares plane was determined. The number in the table is the
number of standard deviations this RMS value deviates from the
expected value (0.0).

# 28 # Error: Connections to aromatic rings out of plane
The atoms listed in the table below are connected to a planar
aromatic group in the sidechain of a protein residue but were found
to deviate from the least squares plane.

For all atoms that are connected to an aromatic side chain in a
protein residue the distance of the atom to the least squares plane
through the aromatic system was determined.  This value was divided
by the standard deviation from a distribution of similar values
from a database of small molecule structures.
 
   6 TYR  (   6 )      OH   6.933
 
# 29 # Warning: Unusual PRO puckering amplitudes
The proline residues listed in the table below have a puckering
amplitude that is outside of normal ranges. Puckering parameters
were calculated by the method of Cremer and Pople [REF]. Normal PRO
rings have a puckering amplitude Q between 0.20 and 0.45
Angstrom. If Q is lower than 0.20 Angstrom for a PRO residue, this
could indicate disorder between the two different normal ring forms
(with C-gamma below and above the ring, respectively). If Q is
higher than 0.45 Angstrom something could have gone wrong during the
refinement.
 
  47 PRO  (  47 )     0.47 HIGH
 
# 30 # Warning: Unusual PRO puckering phases
The proline residues listed in the table below have a puckering phase
that is not expected to occur in protein structures. Puckering
parameters were calculated by the method of Cremer and Pople
[REF]. Normal PRO rings approximately show a so-called envelope
conformation with the C-gamma atom above the plane of the ring
(phi=+72 degrees), or a half-chair conformation with C-gamma below
and C-beta above the plane of the ring (phi=-90 degrees). If phi
deviates strongly from these values, this is indicative of a very
strange conformation for a PRO residue, and definitely requires a
manual check of the data.

 
  13 PRO  (  13 )    107.6 envelop C-beta (108 degrees)
  47 PRO  (  47 )   -137.7 envelop C-delta (-144 degrees)
  56 PRO  (  56 )    -63.7 envelop C-beta (-72 degrees)
  92 PRO  (  92 )   -155.1 half-chair N/C-delta (-162 degrees)
 130 PRO  ( 130 )    -65.9 envelop C-beta (-72 degrees)
 
# 31 # Warning: Torsion angle evaluation shows unusual residues
The residues listed in the table below contain bad or abnormal
torsion angles.

These scores give an impression of how ``normal'' the torsion
angles in protein residues are. All torsion angles except omega are
used for calculating a `normality' score. Average values and
standard deviations were obtained from the residues in the WHAT IF
database. These are used to calculate Z-scores.  A residue with a
Z-score of below -2.0 is poor, and a score of less than -3.0 is
worrying.  For such residues more than one torsion angle is in a
highly unlikely position.
 
  47 PRO  (  47 )   -3.1652

# 32 # Warning: Backbone torsion angle evaluation shows unusual conformations
The residues listed in the table below have abnormal backbone torsion
angles.

Residues with ``forbidden'' phi-psi combinations are listed, as
well as residues with unusual omega angles (deviating by more than
3 sigma from the normal value). Please note that it is normal if
about 5 percent of the residues is listed here as having unusual
phi-psi combinations.

# 33 # Note: Ramachandran Z-score OK
The score expressing how well the backbone conformations of all residues
are corresponding to the known allowed areas in the Ramachandran plot is
within expected ranges for well-refined structures.
 
 Ramachandran Z-score : -2.292
 
# 34 # Warning: Omega angle restraints not strong enough
The omega angles for trans-peptide bonds in a structure is
expected to give a gaussian distribution with the average around
+178 degrees, and a standard deviation around 5.5. In the current
structure the standard deviation of this distribution is above 7.0,
which indicates that the omega values have been under-constrained.
 
 Standard deviation of omega values : 7.202
 
# 35 # Note: chi-1/chi-2 angle correlation Z-score OK
The score expressing how well the chi-1/chi-2 angles of all residues
are corresponding to the populated areas in the database is
within expected ranges for well-refined structures.
 
 chi-1/chi-2 correlation Z-score : 1.125
 
# 36 # Warning: Inside/Outside residue distribution unusual
The distribution of residue types over the inside and the outside of the
protein is unusual. Normal values for the RMS Z-score below are between
0.84 and 1.16. The fact that it is higher in this structure could be
caused by transmembrane helices, by the fact that it is part of a
multimeric active unit, or by mistraced segments in the density.
 
inside/outside RMS Z-score : 1.210
 
# 37 # Note: All atoms are sufficiently far away from symmetry axes
None of the atoms in the structure is closer than 0.77 Angstrom to
a proper symmetry axis.
 
# 38 # Error: Abnormally short interatomic distances
The pairs of atoms listed in the table below have an unusually
short distance.

The contact distances of all atom pairs have been checked. Two
atoms are said to `bump' if they are closer than the sum of their
Van der Waals radii minus 0.40 Angstrom. For hydrogen bonded pairs
a tolerance of 0.55 Angstrom is used.  The first number in the
table tells you how much shorter that specific contact is than the
acceptable limit. The second distance is the distance between the
centers of the two atoms.

The last text-item on each line represents the status of the atom
pair.  The text `INTRA' means that the bump is between atoms that
are explicitly listed in the PDB file. `INTER' means it is an
inter-symmetry bump. If the final column contains the text 'HB',
the bump criterium was relaxed because there could be a hydrogen
bond. Similarly relaxed criteria are used for 1--3 and 1--4
interactions (listed as 'B2' and 'B3', respectively). If the last
column is 'BF', the sum of the B-factors of the atoms is higher
than 80, which makes the appearance of the bump somewhat less
severe because the atoms probably aren't there anyway.

Bumps between atoms for which the sum of their occupancies is lower
than one are not reported. In any case, each bump is listed in only
one direction.

# 39 # Warning: Abnormal packing environment for some residues
The residues listed in the table below have an unusual packing
environment.

The packing environment of the residues is compared with the
average packing environment for all residues of the same type in
good PDB files.  A low packing score can indicate one of several
things: Poor packing, misthreading of the sequence through the
density, crystal contacts, contacts with a co-factor, or the
residue is part of the active site. It is not uncommon to see a few
of these, but in any case this requires further inspection of the
residue.

# 40 # Note: No series of residues with bad packing environment
There are no stretches of three or more residues each having a quality
control score worse than -4.0.
 
# 41 # Note: Structural average packing environment OK
The structural average quality control value is within normal ranges.
 
 
Average for range    1 - 130 :  -1.016
 
# 42 # Warning: Low packing Z-score for some residues
The residues listed in the table below have an unusual packing
environment according to the 2nd generation quality check. The score
listed in the table is a packing normality Z-score: positive means
better than average, negative means worse than average. Only residues
scoring less than -2.50 are listed here. These are the "unusual"
residues in the structure, so it will be interesting to take a
special look at them.
 
  57 PHE  (  57 )    -3.14
 
# 43 # Note: No series of residues with abnormal new packing environment
There are no stretches of four or more residues each having a quality
control Z-score worse than -1.75.
 
# 44 # Warning: Structural average packing Z-score a bit worrysome
The structural 2nd generation average quality control value is a bit low.

The protein is probably threaded correctly, but either poorly
refined, or it is just a protein with an unusual (but correct)
structure. The average quality of properly refined Xray
structures is  0.0+/-1.0.
 
 All   contacts    : Average = -0.530 Z-score =  -3.35
 BB-BB contacts    : Average = -0.041 Z-score =  -0.28
 BB-SC contacts    : Average = -0.754 Z-score =  -4.06
 SC-BB contacts    : Average =  0.058 Z-score =   0.52
 SC-SC contacts    : Average = -0.799 Z-score =  -4.09
 
# 45 # Note: Backbone oxygen evaluation OK
All residues for which the local backbone conformation could be
found in the WHAT IF database have a normal backbone oxygen
position.
 
# 46 # Warning: Unusual rotamers
The residues listed in the table below have a rotamer that is not
seen very often in the database of solved protein structures.  This
option determines for every residue the position specific chi-1
rotamer distribution.  Thereafter it verified whether the actual
residue in the molecule has the most preferred rotamer or not. If
the actual rotamer is the preferred one, the score is 1.0. If the
actual rotamer is unique, the score is 0.0. If there are two
preferred rotamers, with a population distribution of 3:2 and your
rotamer sits in the lesser populated rotamer, the score will be
0.66. No value will be given if insufficient hits are found in the
database.

It is not necessarily an error if a few residues have rotamer
values below 0.3, but careful inspection of all residues with these
low values could be worth it.

# 47 # Warning: Unusual backbone conformations
For the residues listed in the table below, the backbone formed by
itself and two neighboring residues on either side is in a
conformation that is not seen very often in the database of solved
protein structures.  The number given in the table is the number of
similar backbone conformations in the database with the same amino
acid in the center.

For this check, backbone conformations are compared with database
structures using C-alpha superpositions with some restraints on the
backbone oxygen positions.

A residue mentioned in the table can be part of a strange loop, or
there might be something wrong with it or its directly surrounding
residues. There are a few of these in every protein, but in any
case it is worth looking at!

# 49 # Warning: Average B-factor problem
The average B-factor for all buried protein atoms normally lies between
10--20. Values around 3--5 are expected for X-ray studies performed
at liquid nitrogen temperature.

Because of the extreme value for the average B-factor, no further analysis
of the B-factors is performed.
 
Average B-factor for buried atoms : 30.521
 
# 50 # Warning: Buried unsatisfied hydrogen bond donors and acceptors
The buried hydrogen bond donors and acceptors listed in the table
below are not involved in a hydrogen bond.

Hydrogen bond donors and acceptors that are buried inside the
protein normally form hydrogen bonds within the protein. If there
are any non hydrogen bonded buried hydrogen bond donors/acceptors
in the structure, they will be listed here.

The polar side chain atoms of ARG, LYS, GLU, ASP, HIS, ASN and GLN
are, when they are buried, almost invariably involved in at least
one hydrogen bond. If any of these atoms are listed, an
investigation should be undertaken.

# 51 # Note: Summary report for users of a structure
This is an overall summary of the quality of the structure as
compared with current reliable structures. This summary is most
useful for biologists seeking a good structure to use for modelling
calculations.

The second part of the table mostly gives an impression of how well
the model conforms to common refinement constraint values. The
first part of the table shows a number of constraint-independent
quality indicators.
 
 Structure Z-scores, positive is better than average:
  1st generation packing quality :  -1.290
  2nd generation packing quality :  -3.351 (poor)
  Ramachandran plot appearance   :  -2.292
  chi-1/chi-2 rotamer normality  :   1.125
  Backbone conformation          :  -1.153
 
 RMS Z-scores, should be close to 1.0:
  Bond lengths                   :   1.041
  Bond angles                    :   1.719
  Omega angle restraints         :   1.309 (loose)
  Side chain planarity           :   2.060 (loose)
  Improper dihedral distribution :   2.071 (loose)
  Inside/Outside distribution    :   1.210 (unusual)
