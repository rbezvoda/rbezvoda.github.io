                    MEDRIN
                    will coordinate activities once fully established. The structure of MedRIN consists of priority

                There have already been several separate/independent SCERIN and MedRIN workshops
                (<a href="http://scerin.eu" target="_blank">http://scerin.eu</a>), which were successful in organizing
                strong teams of network participants,
                including researchers, remote-sensing experts and professionals from the operational agencies, who
                agreed on a common set of network goals, networks structure and priority objectives. The RIN’s
                priorities were outlined and their needs for networking and capacity building initiatives were
                formulated. The workshops have focused on the specific LCLUC challenges in the different countries, and
                have initiated several regional collaborative activities. </p>

                There was also one highly successful

                 which focused on <i> ‘Ecosystem health,
                    drought, and wildfires in the context of climate change’</i>, reviewed the priorities of the
                networks and outlined topics and activities of common interest for both SCERIN and MedRIN.
