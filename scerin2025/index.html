            <h3>Focus</h3>
            <p>
                The Joint Workshop will focus on Regional LCLUC associated with extreme events, such as fires, droughts, floods, earthquakes and armed conflicts, which all present challenges for forestry, agriculture and urban management and remote sensing monitoring.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will discuss the similarities and differences observed in the SCERIN and MedRIN areas, with remote sensing topics to address, including: water scarcity, heat waves, droughts, flash floods, geophysical hazards, urban expansion, pressures due to tourism, regional wars and migrations, and human health.
            </p>


            </p>
    
        <h3>
            Objectives
        </h3>
        <p>The goal of the workshop is to identify the LCLUC driving forces and consider our ability via remote sensing to monitor their dynamics and address the challenges.</p>
        <p>The Joint Workshop aims to:</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>inform about ongoing major scientific efforts and projects within the SCERIN countries, which invite joint contribution in follow-up activities;</li>
                <li>learn about the major programmatic and research activities within the MedRIN countries, and plan joint follow-up activities;</li>
                <li>advance the ongoing activities of the SCERIN and MedRIN thematic network focus groups;</li>
                <li>review and update the RINs goals and long-term plans, and foster new ideas for joint network activities and collaborations.</li>

                    Turkey and other Mediterranean nations, as well as crossover memberships with SCERIN nation-state
                    community members. A North African Regional Information Network (NARIN) is being established and
                    MEDRIN
                    will coordinate activities once fully established. The structure of MedRIN consists of priority
                    topics
                    of the region identified by the community, and include relevant land-cover / land-use change

                There have already been several separate/independent SCERIN and MedRIN workshops
                (<a href="http://scerin.eu" target="_blank">http://scerin.eu</a>), which were successful in organizing
                strong teams of network participants,
                including researchers, remote-sensing experts and professionals from the operational agencies, who
                agreed on a common set of network goals, networks structure and priority objectives. The RIN’s
                priorities were outlined and their needs for networking and capacity building initiatives were
                formulated. The workshops have focused on the specific LCLUC challenges in the different countries, and
                have initiated several regional collaborative activities. </p>
            <p>
                There was also one highly successful

                    Capacity Building Workshop on EOS June 15-17, 2021</a>
                 which focused on <i> ‘Ecosystem health,
                    drought, and wildfires in the context of climate change’</i>, reviewed the priorities of the
                networks and outlined topics and activities of common interest for both SCERIN and MedRIN.
